-----------The following is a description of the data files in inst/extdata------------


The following five files store annotated genes for four diseases (e.g., Leigh disease, retinitis pigmentosa, colorectal carcinoma, schizophrenia) across five datasets (e.g., EnrichDO, DOSE, DisGeNET, MalaCards, DISEASE).

DISEASE_Anno.xlsx
This file stores genes related to four diseases in the knowledge class of the DISEASE database. Each sheet in the file represents a disease, and the name of sheet is the corresponding disease name.

DisGeNET_Anno.xlsx
This file stores the curated genes related to four diseases from the DisGeNET database. Each sheet in the file represents a disease, and the name of sheet is the corresponding disease name.

DOSE_Anno.csv
This file stores all disease-gene relationship from R package--DOSE.(This data is located in DOSE/data/DO2EG.rda)

EnrichDO_directAnno.csv
This file stores the mapping between the original DO Term and gene that has not been processed by the true path. (Note: There is no top-level node DOID:4 in this file)

MalaCards_Anno.xlsx
The file stores the elite genes associated with four diseases in the MalaCards database. Each sheet in the file represents a disease, and the name of sheet is the corresponding disease name.



ALL_BP_genes.csv
This file stores the differential gene data of ALL, and the number of related gene intersections with BP ontology is 189

Alzheimer_curated.csv
This file stores the curated protein coding genes associated with Alzheimer's in the DisGeNET database

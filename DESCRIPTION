Description: This package combines topological properties of 
    disease ontology structure to implement disease ontology 
    enrichment analysis.Enrichment analyses including a variety 
    of statistical models and visualization schemes for discovering 
    the disease-gene relationship under biological big data.
    EnrichDO exhibits higher accuracy that often yield more specific 
    significant DO terms, which alleviate the over enriched problem.
